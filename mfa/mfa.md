# Call Deflection
- Call deflection is when you offer a customer an alternative *digital channel* either before or during a call
- The customer must be offered to switch to a channel other than the telephone
    - Phone calls are generally more expensive than digital channels. According to McKinsey, adopting digital channels can **reduce costs by up to 40%**
- In some cases, customer experience is not optimal over the phone
- Some customers prefer to communicate channels other than phone calls

- Improves the customer experience (CX) by making:
    - By deflecting a portion of those calls to more efficient digital channel
- Do not degrade the customer experience by
    - Hiding the phone number
    - Artificially increasing the wait time
    - Restricting customer service hours


# Customer Journey
-  Set of steps that the customer takes when interacting with the company
-  After finding the **Contact Us** page, customers can reach out to solve their problem with different options - channels:
    - Email
    - Phone
    - Live chat
    - Social
    - Messaging
- Each of these channels offer a different customer experience
- Goal is to find out the **right channel** to offer at the **right time** to :
    - guarantee **great customer experience** 
    - provide **high engagement** 
    - provide  good ROI 
- Company should pursue its goals with considering the customers’ expectations
- Customers don't like 
    - long wait times
    - redundant IVRs
    - repeating themselves

## Which channel deflect calls to
- customers choose a channel based on their habits and convenience

# Payment over phone issues
- The customer may not trust the agent by giving them their credit card number over the phone
- If the agent misunderstands certain numbers in credit card, the payment will be refused
- If the customer is in a public place, they will not be able to give their confidential information like credit card information


## Operations best suited for digital channels
- Signing contracts
- Sending documents
- Filling out complex forms

# Call Abandonments
-  Calls are synchronous interactions—meaning once the user has dialled a number, they must wait for an agent to pick up. If the call is interrupted, there is no way to resume it during the conversation, and the customer must start the entire process again
- Call Deflection can help in reducing Call Abandonments 


# Models

    - How the customer reached the **Contact Us** page
