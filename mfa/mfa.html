  - MFA is a secure authentication method that requires users to prove their identity by supplying **two or more pieces of evidence (or “factors”)** when they log in.
  - One factor is something the **user knows**, such as their username and password. Other factors are verification methods that the user has in their **possession**, such as an **authenticator app or security key**. 

  
  ![MFA ](https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_70/learn/modules/identity_login/identity_login_2fa/images/0c709899654707ee7b79f3d569dde7d7_identity-2-fa-know-and-have.png)
  - By tying user access to **multiple types of factors**, MFA makes it much harder for common threats like **phishing attacks and account takeovers** to succeed.

  - Salesforce as your partner in **protecting your customer data**, we're announcing that, beginning **February 1, 2022**, Salesforce will begin requiring customers to enable MFA **in order to access** Salesforce products.
  - Email, SMS text messages, and phone calls aren’t allowed as MFA verification methods because email credentials are more easily compromised, and text messages and phone calls can be intercepted.
    - It’s a lot harder for bad actors to get control of an actual mobile device or physical security key than it is to infiltrate an email account or hack a  cell phone number.

  - Does SSO satisfy the MFA requirement?
    - Yes :  as long as all of your Salesforce products are integrated with SSO, **with MFA enabled on the IdP**, and all users who access a Salesforce product’s user interface do so via SSO. 
      - Note that you must use a federated SSO solution based on :
         - Security Assertion Markup Language (**SAML**) or 
         - **OpenID** Connect standard protocols. 
          - [How to use Google as OpenID Connect provider for Salesforce?](https://github.com/mohan-chinnappan-n/cli-dx/blob/master/oid/openId-connect.md)
      - Delegated Authentication does not satisfy the MFA requirement.

## Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP)
- TOTP is a computer algorithm that generates a one-time password (OTP) which uses the **current time** as a source of uniqueness.
- Unique numeric passwords are generated with a standardized algorithm that uses the current time as an input. 
- A code is valid for 30 seconds and then a new one is generated.
- TOTP authenticator apps can generate codes even if the user’s phone doesn’t have a data or internet connectio

## Security Keys
- Security keys are small physical devices that are easy to use because there’s nothing to install and no codes to enter. 
![yubikey](https://media.wired.com/photos/5ad53457f962fc0661ab9847/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/yubikey.jpg)
- This is a great option if users don’t have a mobile device or if cell phones aren’t allowed on the premises.
- Security keys make MFA logins fast. A user simply:
  - 1. Connects their key to the computer
  - 2. Presses the key’s button to verify their identity

- [ Single Sign-On vs. MFA: Do You Know The Difference? ](https://fortifiedhealthsecurity.com/blog/single-sign-on-vs-mfa-do-you-know-the-difference/)
  - Users log in to Salesforce and are prompted to provide a supported MFA verification method to confirm their identity.
